# EAG-Session-01 Assignment - Basic Chrome Extension

**Assignment Overview**

- Let's make something. Now I am going to show you how to make a Chrome Plugin without knowing a lot of stuff. See and learn. 
- Your assignment is to make something unique and really useful. It should be something that you CAN use. This course is about learning how to make things, so let us remove any hesitation that we may have. Here are few ideas:
- Show unread emails from "all" email accounts (I have like 10) in a list
- Show Andrej Karpathy's latest like or tweet
- Translate a few lines on the current page into German or Kannada
- Show the latest TV series on "all" OTT networks
- A Chrome Screen Saver that shows Jokes on AI or Beautiful Quotes
- A plugin that finds the price of the product you're looking at on Amazon on different websites
- Dark or Un-Dark Themer
- Fill in the form
- Once done, upload a short YouTube video and share link with me!
- Scores are subjective, based on how much effort you've put in or how useful that plugin would be.
